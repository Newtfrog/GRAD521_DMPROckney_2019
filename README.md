Data Managament plan for the research project Lovellhood salamanders

Context: I investigated the impact of multiple environmental factors on the 1) total level of salamander activity 2) what species and age level of salamanders. The data was collected from early December 2017 to Mid April 2018 on 5 transacts all ~ 0.5 miles in length, all with similar elevations (two people per transact). All data collected was observational and nothing was disturbed (salamanders were not touched, no logs overturned, etc.)
