# Data description
I investigated the impact of multiple environmental factors on the 1) total level of salamander activity 2) what species and age level of salamanders. The data was collected from early December 2017 to Mid April 2018 on 5 transacts all ~ 0.5 miles in length, all with similar elevations (two people per transact). All data collected was observational and nothing was disturbed (salamanders were not touched, no logs overturned, etc.)
Transact 1 – collected 10 nights
  Start coordinates: N 37.91432 W 122.56610  End coordinates: N 37.91444 W 122.56652
Transact 2 – collected 9 nights
  Start coordinates: N 37.91194 W 122.56375  End coordinates: N 37.91444 W 122.56652
Transact 3 – collected 10 nights
  Start coordinates: N 37.91432 W122.56652   End coordinates: N 37.91194 W 122.56375
Transact 4 – collected 6 nights (when heavy rain, parts were impassable)
  Start coordinates:  N 37.91242 W 122.57052 End coordinates: N 37.91113 W 122.57719
Transact 5 – collected 2 nights (only in March and April)
  Start coordinates:  37.91063 -122.56432 End coordinates: 37.91069 -122.56432

# Roles and responsibilities
Heidi Rockney, as the sole PI and funder will have all responsibility maintaining data access and storage. The research data deos not belong to any instiitute or government agency. Heidi Rockney will keep the data accessible through GitHub and her personal website (https://heidirockney.wixsite.com/thisandthat/research). The data generated will be presented in a peer-reviewed journal and science communication short video. All data is under Heidi Rockney's copyright.

# Data standards and metadata
The following data were collected:
Data collected:
1)	Type of habitat and disturbance level was noted on each transact. (i.e. redwood vs. mixed oak) 
2)	Presence of water (and if permanent vs. ephemeral)
3)	Level of disturbance (high level = transact road vs. medium level = transact on trail.
4)	Environmental data collected every for every time doing transact:
  a.	Start and end time
  b.	Humidity and temperature at start and end time
  c.	Sunset time
  d.	Presence of rain (level – low to high and intermittent to constant) /wind (level – low to high and intermittent to constant)/clouds (low to high)
  e.	Moon 
  i.	Phase, rise and set time and % visibility according to weather records
  f.	Ground
  i.	Dampness level (none, vs. low to high)
  ii.	If rained earlier in the day or previous night
5)	Salamander data collected every for every time doing transact:
  a.	Species of salamander
  b.	Level of activity (are they partially in hole or all the way out – if I could see 4 legs I counted them as out)
  c.	Age of salamander (hatchling, juvenile, adult (small or large))

All temperature and humdity readings were taken with a fluke 921 temperature and Humidity probe. All data on moon phase, set and time as well as sunset time were gathered from https:/willyweather.com. Level of disturbace and habitat type are subjectable, so photos and videos were taken for each transact.

# Storage and security
All data will be stored at a minimum of three locations. There will be publicably accessible data on GitHub, there will be 2 personal backups and data will also be store in icloud. The data will be acessible for a minimum of 10 years.
