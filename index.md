# Data description
I investigated the impact of multiple environmental factors on the 1) total level of salamander activity 2) what species and age level of salamanders. The data was collected from early December 2017 to Mid April 2018 on 5 transacts all ~ 0.5 miles in length, all with similar elevations (two people per transact). All data collected was observational and nothing was disturbed (salamanders were not touched, no logs overturned, etc.)

Data collected:
1)	Type of habitat and disturbance level was noted on each transact. (i.e. redwood vs. mixed oak 
2)	Presence of water (and if permanent vs. ephemeral)
3)	Level of disturbance (high level = transact road vs. medium level = transact on trail.
4)	Environmental data collected every for every time doing transact:
a.	Start and end time
b.	Humidity and temperature at start and end time
c.	Sunset time
d.	Presence of rain (level – low to high and intermittent to constant) /wind (level – low to high and intermittent to constant)/clouds (low to high)
e.	Moon 
i.	Phase, rise and set time and % visibility according to weather records
f.	Ground
i.	Dampness level (none, vs. low to high)
ii.	If rained earlier in the day or previous night
5)	Salamander data collected every for every time doing transact:
a.	Species of salamander
b.	Level of activity (are they partially in hole or all the way out – if I could see 4 legs I counted them as out)
c.	Age of salamander (hatchling, juvenile, adult (small or large))
